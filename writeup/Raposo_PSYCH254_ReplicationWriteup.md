## Sarah's Replication Project Proposal (Lewis & Oyserman, 2015)

### Justification

I will replicate Study 7 from Lewis & Oyserman (2015) Psych Science. In part, I selected this paper  because it was in the 2015 issue of Psych Science, and so it would qualify for the class paper should I complete the replication. I also
chose this paper because it uses simple written stimuli. I have no experience with Javascript, so I anticipate that this will allow
me to complete the replication during the course. Most importantly, however, my main interest in this paper is that it will complement
my ongoing research on how we think about the future and getting older. In Study 7, the authors found support for the hypothesis
that fine-grained time metrics (e.g., days vs. months) would reduce temporal discounting (i.e., the tendency to prefer items/rewards now rather
than in the future, even if future rewards would be greater) and that this relationship would be mediated by making people 
feel more connected to their future self.


### Description of Stimuli and Procedures, and Challenges

#### Stimuli

**Independent Variable**
The first independent variable is scenario (saving for college or retirement). The second independent variable is time metric
 (fine-grained vs. gross-grained). Stimuli include the 4 scenario x time metric vignettes.
 1. "Imagine you have a newborn child. You realize your child will be ready for college in only 6,570 days."
 2. "Imagine you have a newborn child. You realize your child will be ready for college in only 18 years."
 3. "Imagine you plan to retire. You realize you will be ready for retirement in only 14,600 days."
 4. "Imagine you plan to retire. You realize you will be ready for retirement in only 40 years."

**Mediators**
Mediators include 'identity connection' and 'identity congruence'. Each are measured using 4 items.

**Dependent Variable**
The dependent variable, temporal discounting, will be assessed with the Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire (Kirby, Petry, & Bickel, 1999). There are several calculations one can make with this scale, but the authors calculated only one: the temporal discount rate (*k*).

**Demographics and Covariates**
Demographic items will include age, gender, income, and years of education. Covariates include interpretation of experienced difficulty (Oyserman, Destin, & Novin, 2015) and grit (Duckworth & Seligman, 2005).

#### Procedures

Participants will read an online consent form and will check a box to indicate their consent. Then, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental conditions. Then, participants will read the vignette to which they are assigned. Next, participants will complete the measures of identity connection and congruence and will complete the temporal discounting measure. Finally, participants will complete demographic items and covariate measures (interpretation of difficulty and grit). Then, participants will be compensated for their time.

#### Challenges

My main challenge will be coding the project in Javascript because I have never previously used this language. An additional challenge will be calculating the temporal discount rate, which I have also not previously done. Fortunately, accessing stimuli for the independent and dependent variables, mediators, and covariates won't be a challenge because they are available on the Open Science Framework. However, it remains unclear how the original authors measured and categorized variables such as income and education. For example, income can be measured continuously and open-ended, or it can be measured categorically (i.e., with a range).
